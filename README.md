# Serverless backend

This example, I have picked up from serverless-kubeless package. I have modified the folder structure and serverless.yml
Do the following to deploy and use the backend:

1. Start Minkube
2. Run `npm install` to install the used npm packages
3. Run `serverless deploy` to deploy the this service in our kubernetes cluster
```console

$ serverless deploy -v
